# contact-manager
This Python Contact Manager stores contacts in a dictionary and lets users add, remove, block, activate, favorite, and search them. Each contact saves phone number, status, and last edited time using the datetime module. A menu-driven loop handles user choices and displays all saved contacts, updating details whenever changes are made.
