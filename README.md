contact-manager
⁂Users can add, remove, block, activate, favorite, and search contacts in this dictionary-based Python contact manager.  The datetime module is used to store each contact's phone number, status, and last edited time.  User selections are handled by a menu-driven loop that shows all saved contacts and updates information whenever modifications are made.

Objective:
This project's main goal is to develop a useful, menu-driven application that illustrates key Python concepts, such as:  Using dictionaries to store structured data (nested dictionaries and key-value pairs).  To divide up business logic, use function definitions.  The input() function is used for user interaction.  For the main menu, use a while loop and if/elif/else statements to control flow.  Changes are timestamped using the datetime module.
Conditions:  Software Requirements:  Python 3.x  Any IDE or code editor (such as PyCharm, VS Code, etc.)  Terminal or Command Prompt are examples of command-line interfaces.  Hardware specifications:  A simple computer system that can run Python  A minimum of 2GB of RAM  Storage for project files and Python installations
Functional Requirements:
