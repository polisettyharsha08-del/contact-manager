contact-manager
⁂This Python Contact Manager stores contacts in a dictionary and lets users add, remove, block, activate, favorite, and search them. Each contact saves phone number, status, and last edited time using the datetime module. A menu-driven loop handles user choices and displays all saved contacts, updating details whenever changes are made

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to create a functional, menu-driven program that demonstrates fundamental Python concepts, including:
Dictionary usage for structured data storage (key-value pairs and nested dictionaries).
Function definitions to compartmentalize business logic.
User interaction using the input() function.
Control flow with if/elif/else statements and a while loop for the main menu.
The use of the datetime module to timestamp changes.
Requirements:

Any code editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
Command-line interface (Terminal or Command Prompt)
3.2 Hardware Requirements
Basic computer system capable of running Python
Minimum 2GB RAM
Storage for Python installation and project files
Functional Requirements

Unblocks a previously blocked contact.
Updates the "edited" timestamp.
Favorite Contact:
Marks the contact as a favorite.
Updates the "edited" timestamp.
Search Contact:
